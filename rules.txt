KNOW THE WORDS

RULES

The players are provided with a set of five random letters and each letter has points ranging from 1 to 5.

A player has to make a word using the provided letters or if unable to do so they can pass their turn to the next player.

The sum of points corresponding to each letter in a word entered by a player is his/her score after that turn.

Repetition of letters is allowed.

For an invalid (meaningless/misspelled) word or a previously entered word zero points will be 	                                    awarded and the playerâ€™s turn will be passed on to the next player.                       

The game ends when all the players pass their turn i.e. all the players are out of words.

 At the end of the game the player scoring the maximum points wins.
